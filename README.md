# A GENERIC AND EXTENDABLE FRAMEWORK FOR BENCHMARKING AND ASSESSING THE CHANGE DETECTION MODELS


Numerous land cover change detection (LCCD) with aerial images models have been developed recently, but there is a lack of widely available benchmarks to quantitatively analyze and compare their performance. To address this gap, our study proposes and formalizes a novel framework for this task. The framework includes three parallel pipelines: cross-testing, noise immunity, and impact of average change size. Each pipeline performs a comparative study on LCCD models.
